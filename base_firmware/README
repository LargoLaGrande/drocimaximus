basic firmware retrieving and content extraction.

Prerequisites
=============

Humax iCord HD Firmware
-----------------------
In order to create your own firmware the original firmware archive provided by
Humax is needed. Download and extract to './original_firmware'.
Will be downloaded and extracted automatically by extract.py too.

-------------
In order to extract the Humax firmware the humidify tool created by af123 is
needed. Download, extract and place in './bin'.
Will not be downloaded and extracted automatically by extract.py.

firmware-mod-kit
----------------
For creating squashfs filesystem images the firmware-mod-kit is needed.
Retrieve using subversion client, compile afterwards.
Will be downloaded and compiled automatically by extract.py too.

 svn checkout http://firmware-mod-kit.googlecode.com/svn/ firmware-mod-kit-read-only
 cd firmware-mod-kit-read-only/trunk/src
 ./configure
 make

Extraction
==========
 python ./extract.py

That's it, that's all -- './extracted_root/' will then contain the extracted
firmware root.
